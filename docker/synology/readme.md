### Synology NAS Lab Setup

The Synology NAS is a very versatile appliance. There is a lot of support for them across the interwebs and I think
that is where the "issues" start. There is so much information in so many places, you could get lost or spend days
trying to find the correct info.

Here you will find all the information I used to setup my Synology NAS for use in my home lab. 

I will cover setup for the following:

1. SSH
2. Powershell
3. Docker
4. VS Code
5. Lab Monitoring
