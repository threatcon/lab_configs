<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product][product-screenshot]

I got tired of writing snippets in OneNote or Notepad++ so I'm putting all my findings here and sharing it with the world.
Or at least with you. (See what I did there?!)

Here's why:
* If I take the time to figure out something, I'm going to use it again, whether I need to or not
* Now all my favorite snippets are in one place and guess what? I'll use Ansible to bootstrap all my projects with this stuff! Ansible FTW!
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

### Built With

This repo is a collection of Ansible playbooks, roles, tasks and Jinja templates. Credit is given to the source of any code from other authors.

* [![Jinja][Jinja]][Jinja-url]

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The code provided assumes you have a basic understanding of Ansible. This is a personal repo I am sharing, and not meant to be a tutorial. 
I have a full time job so any support will be limited with no implied warranties or guarantees.

### Prerequisites

Since this is an Ansible repo... Ansible. Any code developed on or for a specific version will be annotated.
Code from other authors will have as much information about tested versions as provided by the original author.


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Add Changelog
